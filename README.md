# Dividend Simulation On Savings Account Balance

This program is meant to simulate your bank balance over an inputted amount of months, using a selected dividend percentage. The simulation can be run as many times as the user wants, and they can put in different values for their balance, dividend percentage, and the amount of months that they want to calculate. After the user is done running simulations, the program will display a graph comparing data from the simulations.
