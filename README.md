# Dividend Simulation On Savings Account Balance

This program is meant to simulate your bank balance over an inputted amount of months, using a selected dividend percentage. The simulation can be run as many times as the user wants, and they can put in different values for their balance, dividend percentage, and the amount of months that they want to calculate. After the user is done running simulations, the program will display a graph comparing data from the simulations. 

This project demonstrates key programming capabilities, including:


**Oject oriented programming**

The Person Class is used to store the user's personal information, while the Savings Class is meant to store the user's banking information, including the Person Object that holds your personal information. 


**Fantastic style**

The code is very readible and easy to follow with the comments provided

 
**Use of multiple programming languages**

The program starts in C++, that is where the user runs and customizes their simulations. Python is run using command line arguments, to graph the user's simulation



Necessary installations: matplotlib for the graphing done in graph.py
